### Series of exercises that give an overview of the OOP paradigm and OCF

#### As seen above I include the notes I have taken and they contain:
- informations needed to understand the exercises
- more general version of informations from C++ documentation
- other ideas that talk about orthodox canonical form or objective oriented programming
- below you will see more in depth dive into specific topics that helped me the most

#### Casting, coming from C understanding the new types of casting was crucial:
- you can find information about the types of casting
- their limitations and proper usage in case by case basis
- related to it talk about const and its behaviour

#### Regex and templates, making the parsing part so much smoother:
- main syntax for using regex in C++ with explanation
- the way the templates work with their advantage and disadvanteges
- beginning of talk about algorithms and containers as they come hand in hand with templates

#### Containers, iterators and applying them to algorithm:
- the default information on how to work on containers with iterators
- some extra information about lambda functions to use the full potential of the above ones
- beginning of the explanation about Ford-Johnson algorithm which needs all of the above

#### Error, writing on paper how Ford-Johnson algorithm should work:
- step by step explanation of the described before algorithm
- there is an error and it clearly shows how confusing algorithms can get
- showing how to visualize some more complicated concepts

#### Correct version of paper Ford-Johnson and most used <algorithms> from C++17
- version written down on smaller number of elements
- skipping some of the explanatios from the one before to make it more clean
- adding helpful algorithms that came in handy for it and modules before it (this one is CPP09/ex02)
###### Hopefully it will help you out as it helped me to start with C++
